""""The hailstone problem (collatz conjecture) is an open problem in the field of number theory in math.

(all of this is inside of a while loop.) (exit condition  == 1)
 - Take any integer (x) (use input and typecasting )
 - if it's odd you multiply it by 3 and add 1 (relevant skills % and if statements) (any odd number divided by 2 has a remainder of 1)
 - if it's even, you divide by 2 (number mod 2 == 0)
 
The problem statement is:

- every number eventually ends in a loop of 4-2-1


67 after 3*67+1
202 after 101
304 after 152
152 after 76
76 after 38
38 after 19
19 odd 58
58


your goal, using while loops and an int variable, print out the path a number takes to hit the 4-2-1"""""
